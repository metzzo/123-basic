Improved: Type creating much faster.
Improved: Function calls much faster (unref() calls are reduced) -> needs some debugging
Fixed: GOTO works again!!
Fixed: myArray[0.5] works
Fixed: ROTOSPRITE / ROTOANIM works as expected - rotates in the middle.

Fixed: Some array speed improvements

Added: EXPORT now with custom name: EXPORT MyAwesomeFunction, "FunnyName" <- generates function called "FunnyName" in JavaScript
Added: Case insensitivity (optional)
Added: Very very very experimental C# target (compiles but does not execute because no library function is ported...) basically it was just a test whether the abstract syntax tree is generic enough...
