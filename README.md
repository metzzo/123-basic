123-basic
=========

123 basic is a backwards to GLBasic compatible compiler that targets HTML5 + JavaScript. So your GLBasic games run with nearly zero modifications.
Due to its previous name (GLBScript) a lot of comments, files and other stuff still has this name. In future all this references should be changed, so everything is called 123basic.

# Usage
To compile 123 basic you need the GLBasic IDE (get it from: http://www.glbasic.de/main.php?lang=en&site=download ). It should compile fine on the trial version of GLBasic.

After you have compiled 123 basic (which does not need any 3rd party library - everything is handcrafted :D), you can start programming.
There will be 3 possibilities to do so:
 * In the GLBasic IDE: Here you can embed a macro which runs the script in the current IDE ("Macro.txt" in the root directory of this project)
 * Have your own texteditor and run the file with your own script.
 * Wait until the Melange IDE is finished, which is a completely web-based development enviroment (this could take a while tough)
