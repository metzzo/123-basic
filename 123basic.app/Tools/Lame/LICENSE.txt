Can I use LAME in my commercial program?  

Yes, you can, under the restrictions of the LGPL.  The easiest
way to do this is to:

1. Link to LAME as separate library (libmp3lame.a on unix or 
   lame_enc.dll on windows)

2. Fully acknowledge that you are using LAME, and give a link
   to our web site, www.mp3dev.org

3. If you make modifications to LAME, you *must* release these
   modifications back to the LAME project, under the LGPL.


*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

The decoding functions provided in LAME use a version of the mpglib decoding 
engine which is under the GPL.  They may not be used by any program not 
released under the GPL unless you obtain such permission from the MPG123 
project (www.mpg123.de).
(yes, we know MPG123 is currently under the LGPL, but we use an older version
that was released under the former license and, until someone tweaks the 
current MPG123 to suit some of LAME's specific needs, it'll continue being 
licensed under the GPL)
